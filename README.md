**Travelling Salesman Optimizer**

Written in C, this program uses simulated annealing to approach optimization of the travelling salesman problem.

It runs for a specified number of iterations, and reads 2D coordinate data from a specified text file.

Currently memory leak-free! (Memcheck tested in Valgrind on UNIX)

To do:

- Implement cryptographically secure random integer generation
- Optimize processing performance
- Explore visualization of graph configuration
