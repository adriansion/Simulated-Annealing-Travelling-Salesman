**Travelling Salesman Optimizer**

Originally written in Java but I am rewriting this project in C to improve my C skills and to hopefully improve efficiency.

This program, given a user-limited number of iterations, will use Simulated Annealing to approach a solution to the Travelling Salesman problem.

To do:

- Write cartographer sub-program, which calculates the distance between all nodes in graph configuration from given adjacency matrix

- Implement primary Simulated Annealing algorithm in C

- Explore workarounds for Java data structure usage
    - this could mean writing more in-built implementations such as included queue data structure
    
- Explore visualization of graph configuration (JFrame used in Java version)
