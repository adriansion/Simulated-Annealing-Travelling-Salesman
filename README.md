**Travelling Salesman Optimizer**

Originally written in Java but I am rewriting this project in C to improve my C skills and to hopefully improve efficiency.

This program, given a user-limited number of iterations, will use Simulated Annealing to approach a solution to the Travelling Salesman problem.

To do:

- Optimize processing performance
- Explore visualization of graph configuration (JFrame used in Java version)
